# Bellevue Open Data Scrape
Scrape open data from City of Bellevue Open Data site (data.bellevuewa.gov) using the REST APIs. This script can be applied to any opend data site, or data set hosted on an Esri based platform (ArcGIS Online, ArcGIS Portal, ArcGIS Server, etc.). The script queries the taret service for the specific fields identified outputing coordinates within the desired projection. While it does not output to a specific file or format, the script was written to get 1/2 way there to any output type one could need.
